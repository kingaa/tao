        • To know and yet think we do not know is the highest
          attainment; not to know and yet think we do know is a
          disease.

        • It is simply by being pained at the thought of having this
          disease that we are preserved from it.

        • The sage has not the disease.  He knows the pain that would
          be inseparable from it, and therefore he does not have it.
